Hi, I'm Hiresh. I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer-II at Adobe Systems, Noida, India. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science
 from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in 2018. During my undergrad, I developed an avid interest towards the applications of
 machine learning and neural networks and have
  worked on multiple projects in this field under [Prof. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/Profile), 
  [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile)
   and [Dr. JL Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/) . 
 I also got an oppurtunity to contribute to some real-world research problems during my internships
  at [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, ISRO](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), [Samsung Research Institute, Noida](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n) 
 and [Media and Data Science Research Lab, Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/).

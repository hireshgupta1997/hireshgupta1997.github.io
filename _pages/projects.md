# Adobe Systems, India

Guide: [Prof. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/poonam/profile)

* Designed an end to end model for generating sentence long descriptions of an input scene, using CNNs to extract image features and RNNs to decode them into natural language.
* Used Beam Search, Scheduled Sampling and Caption re-ranking strategies to improve the caption quality.
  
# Water Quality Analysis using Machine Learning Techniques

Guide: [Dr. JL Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/) (Jul’17 - Dec’17)

* Applied statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to monitor water quality from different water sources in India.
  
# Image Super Resolution using deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Guide: [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile)

* Implemented a deep CNN from scratch to generate a higher quality/ detailed version of the low quality input image.
* The model outperformed the traditional heuristic based approaches on Timofte benchmark. The research was also presented in a paper at [APOGEE](https://www.bits-apogee.org/), BITS Pilani.
